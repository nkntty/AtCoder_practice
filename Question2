1) Hash / Frequency Counting (ABC-B)
Distinct Count

Given N and A (length N), output how many distinct values appear.

Input

N
A0 A1 ... A(N-1)


Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 2e5, |Ai| ≤ 1e9
Output: one integer

2) Two Pointers (ABC-C)
Shortest Subarray With Sum ≥ K

Given N, K, and an array A of positive integers, find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is at least K. If none, output -1.

Input

N K
A0 A1 ... A(N-1)


Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 2e5, 1 ≤ Ai ≤ 1e9, 1 ≤ K ≤ 1e18
Output: one integer

3) Greedy (ABC-B/C)
Minimum Coins

Given an amount X and coin values A, B, C (positive integers), you may use any number of each coin. Output the minimum number of coins to make exactly X, or -1 if impossible.

Input

X A B C


Constraints: 1 ≤ X ≤ 1e6, 1 ≤ A,B,C ≤ 1e6
Output: one integer

(Hint-free note: greedy may or may not work; you must decide.)

4) Binary Search on Answer (ABC-C)
Minimum Capacity

You have N packages with weights W[i] (positive). Ship them in order using at most D days. Each day you can ship a consecutive group with total weight ≤ C. Find the minimum C that makes it possible.

Input

N D
W0 W1 ... W(N-1)


Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 2e5, 1 ≤ D ≤ N, 1 ≤ Wi ≤ 1e9
Output: minimum C

5) Graph BFS (ABC-C)
Shortest Path in Grid

Given an H×W grid of . and #, find the shortest path length from S to G moving 4-directionally. Output -1 if unreachable.

Input

H W
grid...


Grid contains exactly one S and one G.

Constraints: 1 ≤ H,W ≤ 1000
Output: distance as an integer
