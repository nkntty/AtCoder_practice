Problem A (ABC-easy) — Count Peaks

You are given an integer N and an array A of length N.

Count how many indices i satisfy:

1 ≤ i ≤ N-2

A[i] is strictly greater than both neighbors: A[i-1] < A[i] and A[i] > A[i+1]

Input
-------------------
N
A0 A1 ... A(N-1)
------------------

Output
-------------
the count
-------------
Constraints

3 ≤ N ≤ 2×10^5

-10^9 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9



Problem B (ABC-B/C-ish) — First Time Reaching a New Maximum

You are given N and an array A of length N.
Let M(i) = max(A[0..i]).

Output all indices i (0-based) such that:

A[i] == M(i) and

A[i] > M(i-1) (i.e., it is a strictly new maximum)

For i = 0, treat it as a new maximum automatically.

Input
-------------
N
A0 A1 ... A(N-1)
--------------
Output
Print the indices in increasing order, separated by spaces.
If none (won’t happen because i=0 always qualifies), print nothing but a newline.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 2×10^5
-10^9 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^9
